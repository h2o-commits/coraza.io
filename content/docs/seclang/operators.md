## BeginsWith

**Description:** Returns true if the parameter string is found at the beginning of the input. Macro expansion is performed on the parameter string before comparison.

**Example:**
```apache
# Detect request line that does not begin with "GET"
SecRule REQUEST_LINE "!@beginsWith GET" "id:149"
```

## Eq

**Description:** Performs numerical comparison and returns true if the input value is equal to the provided parameter. Macro expansion is performed on the parameter string before comparison.

**Example:**
```apache
# Detect exactly 15 request headers
SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS_NAMES "@eq 15" "id:153"
```
**Note:** If a value is provided that cannot be converted to an integer (i.e a string) this operator
will treat that value as `0`.
